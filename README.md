# A Web Scraper in PHP/NodeJS

We're going to use this utility to go through our old Concrete5 website, grab our blog posts, and turn them into Wordpress posts.

Concrete5 doesn't really offer a good system for exporting just the HTML from a certain block, and even then, it would take a while to manually enter it into Wordpress. Hopefully this works for us.

Currently focusing on the PHP version, since Wordpress is in PHP. But the NodeJS version is there just for fun.
